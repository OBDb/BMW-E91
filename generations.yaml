    description: "The BMW E91 is the Touring (wagon) variant of the fifth-generation 3 Series, sharing its platform with the E90 sedan, E92 coupe, and E93 convertible. The E91 combined the driving dynamics of the 3 Series with enhanced practicality, offering expanded cargo capacity through its wagon body style while maintaining BMW's renowned handling characteristics. Engine options mirrored those of the sedan, ranging from efficient four-cylinder diesels to powerful six-cylinder petrol units, with many markets receiving the high-performance 335i with its twin-turbocharged 3.0L straight-six producing 306 HP. Transmission options included six-speed manual and automatic gearboxes, with later models receiving a more efficient eight-speed automatic. The E91 featured advanced technology for its time, including iDrive infotainment on higher-spec models, run-flat tires, and various electronic driving aids. A facelift (LCI - Life Cycle Impulse) in 2008 brought revised styling, updated engines including more efficient diesel options, and enhanced technology features. The E91 Touring appealed to buyers seeking the perfect balance between driving pleasure and practical versatility, establishing itself as a premium alternative to larger SUVs with better driving dynamics and efficiency."
